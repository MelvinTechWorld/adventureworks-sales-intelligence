## 🔎 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze AdventureWorks sales data to uncover:

- Revenue trends  
- Profitability drivers  
- Regional performance differences  
- Customer behavior patterns  
- Product-level revenue concentration  

The focus was not only on analysis, but on translating data into actionable business insight.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Measure overall revenue and profit performance  
- Analyze profitability across regions  
- Track monthly sales trends (2005–2008)  
- Identify top-performing products  
- Segment customers using RFM analysis  
- Apply KMeans clustering for behavioral grouping  
- Build a basic monthly sales forecasting model  

---

## 📊 Executive Dashboard Results

### 🔑 Key KPIs

- **Total Revenue:** $29M  
- **Total Profit:** $12M  
- **Profit Margin:** 41%  
- **Average Order Value:** $1,061  

---

### 🌍 Regional Performance

- North America leads both revenue and profitability  
- Pacific and Europe generate similar revenue but slightly lower profit contribution  

---

### 📈 Revenue Trend

Revenue growth accelerated significantly in 2008, showing strong upward momentum in the later period of analysis.

---

## 🧠 Advanced Analytics

### RFM Customer Segmentation

Customers were segmented using:

- Recency  
- Frequency  
- Monetary Value  

Resulting segments included:

- VIP  
- Loyal  
- At Risk
